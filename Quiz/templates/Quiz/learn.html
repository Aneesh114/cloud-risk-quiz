<h1> Learn more about risks involved in Cloud Computing and Webapp Development </h1><br><br>
<h2> Are you trying to develop your first Webapp or work on cloud? Here are a few points that you need to consider...</h2> <br>
<h4> 1. Draw a basic flowchart of what your application is about and the functionalities that are involved in it. </h4>  
<p> Before jumping into the coding part, one needs to know what are the features that the Webapp must have. This information helps us to get a better idea on the path that we need to take to get this Application up and running </p>
<br>
<h4> 2. Choose the suitable resource to work on the development. </h4>
<p> We need to understand that not every backend or frontend development languages work in the same way. We need to filter out the platform, languages and other resources that are necessary based on the functions that the app is going to perform. You can also choose frameworks like Django, Angular, Flask and many more that are built from fundamental languages like python to ease out the coding part. To learn more about frameworks and their different kinds, you can click on the links below. </p>

<h4> 3. Learn about the different types of attacks that can happen on the Webapp and try to secure it by using Security Tools. </h4>
<p>  Data is one of the most important assets of an organisation or a nation. People with malicious intent are always waiting for an opportunity to breach the application and exchange the data for money. Since in cloud computing everything happens remotely,there are higher chances of the Application getting compromised. There are various kinds of attacks than can be targeted on an Application and then we have techniques that can be used to prevent them from happening. A few links are provided below regarding the same. <br>

<h4> 4. Understand Shared Responsibility Model. </h4>
<p>When a third party platform provides cloud services to us, it is their responsibility to secure the data at their data centres and the platform that they provide. However we have a responsibility in securing the Application like configuring the network and users. This is explained by the Shared Responsibility Model. Enable an Identity Access Management System to, generate and store the audit/logs in a database, analyze the logs by running queries to find any discrepancies. Encrypt data and try to hide confidential information like account credentials using services like Azure Key Vault. </p>

<h3> Best Cloud Practices. </h3>
<p> Developing the app is just 30% of the work. Security the app and maintaining its integrity in the long run is the major hurdle. We need to be able to scale-up our resources and services once there are new users. This can be done by cloud computing. Cloud changed the way people used to work. It helped us to acquire high computation power remotely with lower budget compared to times from the past. But this major breakthrough is a double-edged sword. If we are planning to use it, we need to completely understand how cloud works and what precaution one needs to take to safeguard data from falling into wrong the wrong hands. Few good Cloud Security Practices are discussed in the link provided below. </p>
